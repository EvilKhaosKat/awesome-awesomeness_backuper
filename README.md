awesome-awesomeness_backuper
============================
Kinda useless 'awesome-awesomeness' rep backuper.<br>
Using torsocks it will bulky calls 'git clone REPOSITORY' for each found git repository from README.md of [awesome-awesomeness](https://github.com/bayandin/awesome-awesomeness) repository.<br>

Launch 'python main.py' to do all the stuff.<br>
By specifying '-dir=awesome_backup_dir' as command line param backup dir can be changed.
