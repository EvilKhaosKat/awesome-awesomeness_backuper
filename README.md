awesome-awesomeness_backuper
============================
Kinda useless 'awesome-awesomeness' rep backuper.<br>
It calls 'git clone REPOSITORY' using toraocks for each found git repository from README.md of [awesome-awesomeness](https://github.com/bayandin/awesome-awesomeness) repository.<br>

Launch `python main.py` to do all the stuff within current directory.<br>
By specifying `-dir=awesome_backup_dir` as command line param backup dir can be changed.

### Prerequisites:
* git
* torsocks
